The crude sensitivity of 5-point TRSs is a good reason for supplementing these scales with precision (transducer) measures when possible (Elble et al, 2006)

In Table VI we present the percent differences “on”-“off” in the four metrics, along with the UPDRS scores (“off” and “on”) for both PDDN subjects. We would expect those differences to be negative because we expect higher metric scores (more pronounced tremor) while off-medication or in a de novo state, and lower after the drug ingestion (“on”). 
From the UPDRS scores of the two volunteers it is clear that these two patients did not suffer from severe hand tremor. Their physician observed that the medication improved mostly the patients’ rigidity (which is not measured by our tool) and less so their tremor. However, it is encouraging to note that the readings of the smartphone’s sensors respond well and follow the expected negative trend of the changes in the UPDRS scores in the “on” state. The only discrepancy is observed in the eR position of volunteer B for all metrics, however for that position there were also no observed clinical changes in the UPDRS “on”-“off” as well.

Tremor is not the main quality of life constraining-aspect of the disease [4], but responds well to dopaminergic medication; as such, its objective quantification can provide useful feedback on the efficacy of the treatment regimen. 
When it comes to PD, it is important to be able to assess patients accurately and frequently in order to adjust their treatment as necessary when variations in the severity of the symptoms occur. Unfortunately, in addition to the time and costs involved, it is difficult for most patients (even more so for those in rural areas), to be monitored frequently by a specialized physician. This creates the need for tools that can aid the physician by assessing a patient’s condition remotely, and that are practical and easy to use. 

The goal of this work is to investigate the use of a smartphone-based tool for assessing PD induced hand tremor. Our approach involves using the phone’s embedded accelerometer and gyroscope sensors to quantify PD hand tremor. Operationally, the patient simply visits a web site [14] and takes up simple postures much like those used in standardized clinical exams, with the smartphone mounted on their hand. The data thus recorded can then be used to classify a subject as healthy or not, and to track the severity of the tremor in PD patients. 
This paper substantially differs from and extends our previous work by 
i) including additional samples from healthy subjects which are age-matched to the PD patients used in our study, 
ii) including data on a small sample of patients off medication in order to quantitatively track the severity of their hand tremor, 
iii) exploring the correlation between our quantitative metrics results and the patients’ (subjective) clinical examination for all supported postures, and 
iv) using a machine learning feature classification approach to choose those metrics which are better at distinguishing between pathological and healthy signals, thus  increase our method’s accuracy. 

The proposed method has been implemented in the form of an app and is available for use on any smartphone with iOS or Android installed, without the need for any downloads or memory-consuming installations [14]. It can be offered as a web-service, so that developers can build their own applications around it and extend its functionality. Our approach does not require the presence of an expert or any kind of special equipment to conduct measurements. It transmits data in real time via TCP/IP, connecting the patient to his physician with no delays, and can benefit the research community by providing anonymized information on PD hand tremor profiles.

This paper is a continuation of our previous work [3]; its main contribution is a statistical comparison between signal-based methods of quantifying Parkinsonian tremor using a smartphone, and the UPDRS scores assigned by a physician specialist, in order to validate our previous approach. We acquired hand tremor signals from twenty-three patients using an iPhone and computed the correlation (Pearson product-moment) between the metrics under consideration and the patients’ UPDRS scores regarding hand tremor. Our results indicate a strong correlation (r>0.7) with high statistical significance (p<0.01), which suggests that our quantitative methods of measuring Parkinsonian hand tremor [3] show promise as a means of systematically tracking that component of the disease, possibly as part of a clinical exam or in telemedicine applications. 

In the following, we will specify the combination of a patient’s hand (Right of Left upper extremity) during each position as rR, rL, eR, and eL for rest-right, rest-left, extended-right, and extended-left, respectively.

As per the protocol described earlier, the volunteers were asked to maintain certain postures for 30 seconds, during which the application automatically collected the accelerometer and gyroscope data and sent them to our server. We then used the data to extract features which quantify and characterize the subjects’ tremor levels. The signals were sampled at 20Hz, which is sufficient to identify events occurring at 9Hz or less [20], such as PD-induced tremor. 
Our web application, being written in PHP and JavaScript, is entirely independent of the client's hardware or software platform. It only demands basic prerequisites such as an embedded accelerometer and gyroscope and one of the most popular smartphone operating systems, iOS or Android. 







Find that thing about UPDRS and why it shouldn't correlate well to the handwriting approach. I think it must be in the 1st or 2nd chapter.

Leave no space between units and the value. 

%Many scientists work at the intersection of engineering, the life sciences and health care to provide solutions for problems in medical practice pertaining to the aforementioned axes. They combine mathematics, statistics and physics with applied sciences, like mechanical and computer engineering, and apply them to established medical practice, either to complement it or even to replace old and problematic techniques. Biomedical engineering, bioinformatics and health informatics are interdisciplinary applied sciences that can offer new insight into the human body and present new diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

-The authors calculated tremor amplitude, tremor regularity, power distribution, defined as the percentage of power within the 3–7Hz frequency band, median power frequency, peak power frequency, power dispersion, defined as the frequency band containing 68\% of total power centered at the median power frequency, power dispersion centered at peak power frequency, and harmonic index.-

Say something about action-intention tremor? A task in Denaults paper (sitting and keeping arms and hands in front while trying to bring the tips of the fingers as close as possible to each other) assesses that

The following was also "butchered" from the same subsection and it could help you in the following chapters:

\hl{Correlation analysis showed that the smartphone on-board processing yielded similar results when compared to the post-processing of the phone's raw signal with all tasks' correlation coefficients being above 0.90 for all calculated characteristics}. Similarly, the smartphone's on-board processing correlated well with the post-processing of the separate accelerometer's signal, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.88 to 0.95 for all tasks and characteristics, except for the results from task 4. However the authors deemed the low correlation of the kinetic task based metrics trivial because the goal was to mainly assess abnormal postural and rest tremor. The most valuable features extracted from the acceleration signals were the time domain related ones, namely tremor amplitude and regularity, whereas the most promising frequency domain features were power distribution, median power frequency and harmonic index. These five characteristics had the highest correlation among the three assessment methods. In order to further validate their method Daneault and his associates recruited 16 patients, 12 diagnosed PD patients, 3 with ET and 1 suffering from multiple sclerosis. They performed a correlation analysis between the results from the smartphone acceleration collection and on-board processing, and a custom scale they created to assess the patients clinically. They found a strong relationship between the amplitude of tremor measured and calculated by the device and the one measured with the scale. The smartphone calculated consistently different amplitude mean values corresponding to each level of the scale, indicating that it could in fact be a valid method of creating tremor profiles over time. 
According to the authors, the reasons for creating a custom rating scale and not using the UPDRS were that:\par
\begin{enumerate}
\item The scale needed to provide a quantitative measure of tremor amplitude, 
\item The scale needed to provide a high degree of precision, i.e., small increments between ordinal values
\item The scale needed to be linear.
\end{enumerate}





%i) including additional samples from healthy subjects which are age-matched to the PD patients used in our study, ii) including data on a small sample of patients off medication in order to quantitatively track the severity of their hand tremor, iii) exploring the correlation between our quantitative metrics results and the patients’ (subjective) clinical examination for all supported postures, and iv) using a machine learning feature classification approach to choose those metrics which are better at distinguishing between pathological and healthy signals, thus  increase our method’s accuracy. The accuracy in separating healthy from PD subjects attained in this work is on par with other works using smartphones’ accelerometers and short-duration data [12]. It is also very close to the sensitivity and specificity achieved in [17], where the authors used sensors of the SHIMMER platform to perform mobile gait analysis. There are works that achieve near 100\% accuracy but do so using day-long signals [18] which may not be practical in our setting. High accuracy (98.5\% sensitivity, 97.5\% specificity) is also achieved using smartphone accelerometer-based gait analysis, with a combination of tests and metrics [19].
